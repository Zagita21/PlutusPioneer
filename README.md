# Plutus Pioneer Program: Second Cohort

## About

These are my personal notes taken while following the [course](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/plutus-pioneer-program/). These notes are the result of my own inquiry into the material and almost everything is expressed in my own words. They might be useful to you, if you are looking for an alternative perspective or explanation of things.

## Contents

* [Haskell Primer](Haskell%20Primer.md) - Introduction to Haskell based on Plutus
* [Week 1](./Week1/Week1.md) - EUTXO and Plutus
* [Week 2](./Week2/Week2.md) - On-chain Plutus Core script, untyped and typed validators
* [Week 3](./Week3/Week3.md) - Script context, transaction info, handling time, parametrized validators

## Disclaimer

Even though I've put my effort into understanding the underlying ideas, the notes might contain incorrect usage of terms and my misinterpretations.

The homework solutions are of my own, based on my understanding of Haskell and Plutus at the moment of implementing them. Therefore, they are not guaranteed to be (and likely are not) efficient or eloquent.
